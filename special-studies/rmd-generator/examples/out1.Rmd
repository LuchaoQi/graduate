Analysis of a Linear Model
==========================

```{r importData}
load("model.RData")
```

Introduction
------------

A linear regression analysis was performed in R, using the function `lm`. The data was fitted to the following model

```{r}
model$call
```

Graphs
------

The following explanatory graphs will be presented unashamedly without commentary.

```{r}
plot(model)
```

Data Analysis
-------------

Next we show the analysis of the data.

```{r}
summary(model)
```

Notice that the p-value is 

```{r}
f <- summary(model)$fstatistic
pValue <- pf(f[1], f[2], f[3], lower=FALSE)
pValue
```

Conclusions
-----------

The results are statistically significant because of the p-value `r pValue`.
